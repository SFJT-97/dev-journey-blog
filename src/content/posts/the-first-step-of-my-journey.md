## Introduction

Hi and welcome you to my personal blog!

The idea of starting this project has been on my mind for a few weeks now, until finally I decided to do something about it. With the tools available today like Astro, Github, TinaCMS and Cloudfare, it didn't take long; a few hours during a sleepless night and *tada!* here it is. I tried to keep it minimal but functional while still somewhat cozy and appealing... I really like the end result tbh.

The footer is giving me nightmares, but oh well... This blog is about the learning journey I'm starting, so consider it a funny easter-egg until I can figure what to do with it.

## The first leg of my journey

If you have read my <a href="https://dev-journey-blog.pages.dev/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: black"><ins>**Home**<ins></a> page or my <a href="https://dev-journey-blog.pages.dev/about/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: black"><ins>**About**<ins></a> page, you would know that *-while I'm not new to coding-* I consider myself an amateur. I have a some paid projects in my back, and experience with popular frameworks and libraries in the Frontend Web and Mobile development sphere; I'm also an Undergraduate Computer Science developer who is currently working towards his BS in CS... But hey, besides how harsh is to get a job nowadays, I know that I can be better and that's why this blog was born.

So now, where do I start? Well, I don't have a full roadmap yet and there are tons of resources out there, so I don't know how or when it'll end; but I know something... <a href="https://roadmap.sh/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: black"><ins>**Roadmap**<ins></a> sounds like a good place to start, I'll be hitting the basics and make my way to the top (or so I hope).
