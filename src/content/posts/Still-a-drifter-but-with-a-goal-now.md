## Introduction

Hello again! I've playing around with [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/ "TinaCMS"), [Tina Cloud](https://app.tina.io/ "Tina Cloud"), [GitHub](https://github.com/ "GitHub") and [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/ "Cloudflare") just enough so I can get the CMS to work in production and not only locally... and now it does! So that's something off my TODO list. I've also optimized a few images/gifs and did some polishing for better accessibility; there's still a couple of things I would like to do before considering this blog done, but I think it's enough to get started for now.

## Where to now?

Looking around [Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/ "Roadmap") I found as a fitting place to start the ["Data Structures & Algorithms"](https://roadmap.sh/datastructures-and-algorithms "\"Data Structures & Algorithms\"") and ["Computer Science"]()
