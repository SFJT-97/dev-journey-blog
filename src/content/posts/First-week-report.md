# Introduction

I'm back, and let me tell you, this week has been **rough** tbh... College went bonkers and left me with a lot on my plate, and also work has been crazy: A few days ago I finished a frontend freelance project and a new one landed on my lap just two days after the fact, also the mobile app team has a stand on a big convention on May so we're throwing a lot of hours at that too.

All in all I can't complain, but it's true that all this chaos did slowed down my self-taught journey. It's not that I'm in a rush or anything, but I do hope to get a lot of work done with this blog and it's purpose by the end of the year.

# Getting started

Like I said, I wanted to start with quite a bit of languages, and so I did. As of today, I've written the typical "Hello World" exercises that are everywhere and a simple Array exercise were I create two arrays and then print their elements in a specific order... So far I'm doing this with: C, C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Ruby, Rust and Swift. I'm starting to see a lot of parallels between a few of them, so I hope that once I get enough momentum it starts to click and it becomes a domino of "Aha!" moments from there. For all but Swift, I've made repositories that I'll keep updated with my progress.

Truth is, I'm still learning the ropes around macOS so I'm taking it slow with Swift locally. Also, I tried to delve into Php too (I've used it in some frontend projects, but eventually I want to go all in with it), but I wanted to do it with Docker; so I'll put it on hold for now, at least until I'm deep into the roadmap.
