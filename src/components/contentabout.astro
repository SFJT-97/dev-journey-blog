            Hi! I'm Santiago
        </h2>
        <p>
            I'm an argentinian-italian born at the very beggining of <s>Space & Time</s> the <i>'Gen Z'</i> generation, currently studying a BS in Computer Science.

            Besides my love for computers, coding and videogames, I'm also former highschool rugby player. During my free time that's not coding-related, I'm an amateur writer and worldbuilder <i>(I've even participated in a few college contests and did quite well IMO)</i>; said hobbies quickly turned my into the Game Master of an ongoing D&D game these last 5 years.

            By the very end of 2019, I started working part-time as an entry-level Frontend Developer. Most of my projects were as a lone Frontend Dev doing landing pages or blogs, but in this time span I also had the opportunity to work and collaborate with small teams on a mobile app.
