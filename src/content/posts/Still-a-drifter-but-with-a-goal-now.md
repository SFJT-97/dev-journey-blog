## Introduction

Hello again! I've playing around with [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/ "TinaCMS"), [Tina Cloud](https://app.tina.io/ "Tina Cloud"), [GitHub](https://github.com/ "GitHub") and [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/ "Cloudflare") just enough so I can get the CMS to work in production and not only locally... and now it does! So that's something off my TODO list. I've also optimized a few images/gifs and did some polishing for better accessibility; there's still a couple of things I would like to do before considering this blog done, but I think it's enough to get started for now.

## Where to now?

Looking around [Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/ "Roadmap") I found that the ["Data Structures & Algorithms"](https://roadmap.sh/datastructures-and-algorithms "\"Data Structures & Algorithms\"") and ["Computer Science"]() as good places to get started in my journey. Both recommend to pick a language, but I'm leaning towards using as many as I can from the recommended ones, whenever possible anyways... Python and Java are a big thing in my college so picking those is a no brainer, and I recently got my first MacBook so learning C related languages would be nice for later delving into Swift.

The main goal, at least for now, is not to become a pro in those languages, but understand the fundamentals that are used when coding with them and that are applicable to any of the aforementioned languages or any others.

While I'm not entirely new to some concepts or things I'm going to start doing, I really meant it when I said that I was going back to the basics. So, for the purposes of this blog and my journey, I'm a complete beginner... An eager to learn beginner.
